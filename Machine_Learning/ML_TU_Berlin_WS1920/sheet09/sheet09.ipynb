For this, we will make use of an existing decision tree implementation (available in `scikit-learn`), that we can then reuse for implementing the two models of interest. As a first step, we download a simple two-dimensional classification dataset: the Iris data.

Conversely, the boosting algorithm prefers small trees as it is able to build complex models even from simple weak regressors."
