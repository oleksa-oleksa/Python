Example: Specific cancer that occurs to 1% of population P(c) = 0.01
Test for this cancer with a 90% chance is positive if you have this cancer (this is sensitivity of the test)
But the test is sometimes is positive even if you don't have a cancer C.
Let's say with another 90% chance is negative if you don't have cancer C (this is specificity of the test)

Question: the prior probability of cancer is 1%, and a sensitivity and specificity are 90%,
what's the probability that someone with a positive cancer test actually has the disease?
