/* 
The derivative of any variable describes how that variable changes over time. 
In a PID controller, the derivative is the rate of change of the error. In digital form, it can be described as:

Derivative = Error â€“ Last Error

Negative values of derivative indicate an improvement (reduction) in the error signal. 
For example, if the last error was 20 and the current error is 10, the derivative will be -10. 
When these negative values are multiplied with a constant, Kd, and are added to the output of the loop, 
it can slow down the system when approaching the target.

The damping effect of the D controller allows the system to have a higher value of Kp and/or Ki without overshooting. 
In consequent, this will give the system a better response time to set point changes. 

However, too high the value of Kd will also have negative effect. 
The D controller tense to amplify the noise exists in the feedback loop. 
If the Kd is too high, the system will become jerky if the feedback loop is noisy.
